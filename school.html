            <h2>When I Say New York Style</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright, folks. If you wanna talk about New York
                City’s good eats, you can’t leave out the kosher dill pickles. If
                you haven’t tasted one, then you’re missing out on a real treat. I
                mean, <b>these crunchy babies are so iconic, you can find them at
                    almost every deli and street cart in the city</b>. They’re a real
                pick-me-up when you’re feeling down or need a quick snack.</p>

            <p class="loose">Lemme paint you a picture: You’re walking down the
                streets of Manhattan, and you catch a whiff of something
                unmistakable. You know it’s coming from a nearby street cart, and
                you can’t resist the temptation to check it out. You order a hot
                dog, and the vendor asks if you want a pickle to go with it. Well of
                course you do! And there it is, the perfect accompaniment to your
                hot dog — a big, juicy, kosher dill pickle, still cold from the
                refrigerated jar. You take a bite, and the satisfying crunch and
                tangy flavor make you remember why you love New York.</p>

            <p class="loose">But it’s not just food carts that serve up these
                pickles. Head into any classic deli in the city, and you’re bound to
                see a big barrel of kosher dill pickles sitting in the corner. You
                order a classic pastrami sandwich or a towering corned beef on rye.
                You ask the guy behind the counter to throw in a few of his best
                kosher dill pickles, and he knows just what you mean. You take a
                bite of that big sandwich, and then follow it up with a bite of
                pickle. The combination of flavors and textures is outta this
                world.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now I’m getting a little <a
                    href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/verklempt-2021-07-21/"><i>verklempt</i></a>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Oh, here’s something you might not know. It’s that
                the word “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber#Kosher_dill">kosher</a>”
                in the pickle world doesn’t necessarily mean following Jewish
                dietary laws. Nope, here <b>kosher refers to the traditional use of
                    garlic and dill in a salt brine</b>. And let me tell you, that’s
                what takes these pickles to the next level.</p>

            <h2>My Pickles Are Fermented and Then Chilled</h2>

            <p class="loose">When it comes to pickles, I don’t mess around. Like
                any New Yorker, I want the best of the best — real, old-fashioned,
                kosher dill pickles, made the way they were meant to be.</p>

            <p class="loose">Let me tell ya. Those supermarket pickles are all
                boiled and processed, which means they’re soggy and drowning in some
                eye-watering salt or vinegar solution. No, no, if you want a real
                pickle, you gotta go for a pickle that’s been fermented. None of
                that boiling nonsense.</p>

            <p class="loose">Me, I make my pickles kosher-style, with a brine of
                water, salt, garlic, and dill — and then leave it alone to ferment.
                <b>It’s what we in the pickle business call
                    “lacto-fermentation”</b> (sv: <i>mjölksyrning</i>), an age-old
                technique that involves letting the natural bacteria in the air
                and on the surface of the cucumbers work their magic and break
                down the natural sugars in the cucumber, converting them into
                acid, which gives us a natural tanginess. After that, I stick
                them in the fridge, which locks in the flavor and texture.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">When you eat a proper kosher dill pickle, you can
                taste the complexity and depth of flavors — the garlic, the dill,
                the tangy brine — that come together with time and patience. It’s a
                whole different ballgame than those pickles you find sitting for
                who-knows-how-long on supermarket shelves.</p>

            <p class="loose">But that’s not all. <b>Fermented pickles are also
                    full of probiotics. I mean good bacteria that help support a healthy
                    gut microbiome</b>. It’s like a two-for-one deal — not only do these
                pickles taste great, but they’re good for you too.</p>

            <h2>That Brine Is Good Stuff</h2>

            <p class="loose">Hold up before you toss out that pickle juice. That
                stuff is like liquid gold, full of flavor and potential. It’s not
                something you wanna waste.</p>

            <p class="loose">Don’t believe me? Try <a
                    href="https://www.seriouseats.com/a-gazillion-ways-to-use-leftover-pickle-juice">adding
                    pickle brine to your salads, dressings, and marinades</a>. It adds a
                tangy kick that’ll take your cooking to the next level. Or, if
                you’re feeling adventurous, you can even <a
                    href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pickle-juice-ice-pops">make
                    popsicles</a> out of it. Yeah, you heard me right. Pickle juice
                popsicles. Trust me, they’re better than they sound.</p>

            <p class="loose">And if you’re feeling thirsty, why not try using
                pickle brine in a <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/4-pickle-cocktails-in-nyc/">cocktail</a>
                or <a href="https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251">chaser</a>?
                It adds a unique flavor that’ll make your drinks stand out from
                the crowd. (Just please drink responsibly, folks.)</p>
