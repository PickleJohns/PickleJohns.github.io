            <h2>When I Say “New York Style”</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright listen up, folks. If you wanna talk about
                New York City’s good eats, you can’t leave out the kosher dill
                pickles. If you haven’t tasted one, then you’re missing out on a
                real treat. I mean, these crunchy babies are so iconic, you can find
                them at almost every deli and street cart in the city. They’re a
                real pick-me-up when you’re feeling down or need a quick snack.</p>

            <p class="loose">Let me paint you a picture: You’re walking down the
                streets of Manhattan, and you catch a whiff of that unmistakable
                smell of brine and vinegar. You know it’s coming from a nearby
                street cart, and you can’t resist the temptation to check it out.
                You order a hot dog, and the vendor asks if you want a pickle to go
                with it. Of course you do! And there it is, the perfect
                accompaniment to your hot dog – a big, juicy, kosher dill pickle,
                still cold from the refrigerated jar. You take a bite, and the
                satisfying crunch and tangy flavor instantly transport you to a New
                York state of mind.</p>

            <p class="loose">But it’s not just street carts that serve up these
                delicious pickles. Head into any classic deli in the city, and
                you’re bound to see a big barrel of kosher dill pickles sitting in
                the corner. These pickles are the perfect snack to enjoy with a
                classic pastrami sandwich or a towering corned beef on rye.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now I’m getting a little <i>verklempt</i>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Oh, here’s something you might not know about the
                word “kosher” in the pickle world. It doesn’t necessarily mean
                following Jewish dietary laws. Nope, <b>“kosher” actually refers to
                    the use of garlic in the pickling brine</b>. And let me tell you,
                that garlic is what takes these pickles to the next level. It’s an
                old-school tradition that’s been around for ages, and it gives
                kosher dill pickles a flavor that’s truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

            <h2>My Pickles Are Fermented</h2>

            <p class="loose">You know, I take my pickles seriously. Unlike those
                bland, supermarket pickles that are boiled and preserved with salt
                or vinegar, <b>my kosher dill pickles are made the old-fashioned
                    way, using a natural lacto-fermentation process</b>
                (sv: <i>mjölksyrning</i>).</p>

            <p class="loose">What’s lacto-fermentation, you ask? It’s a
                technique that’s been used for centuries, where the natural bacteria
                in the air and on the surface of the cucumbers are allowed to do
                their thing and create a delicious brine that results in a crisp,
                crunchy texture and a tangy, briny flavor that’ll knock your socks
                off.</p>

            <p class="loose">And that’s not all. <b>These pickles are packed
                    with probiotics, meaning that they’re full of good bacteria</b>.
                That’s real important for a healthy gut microbiome. So not only are
                these pickles delicious, but they’re good for you too.</p>

            <h2>Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright I’m about to drop some pickle knowledge on
                you. When it comes to pickling, you can use all kinds of cucumbers,
                but <b>it’s really worth it to get your hands on the freshest ones
                    possible</b>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now, in Sweden, you’re likely to come across
                English cucumbers in the supermarket. These long, thin-skinned
                cucumbers are available year-round and are wrapped in plastic to
                keep them fresh and reduce food waste. They have a mild flavor that
                works well for making pickle spears, so go ahead and slice them
                up.</p>

            <p class="loose">But if it’s the summer, you can look for Västerås
                cucumbers. These small, firm cucumbers are grown outdoors, and
                they’re perfect for pickling. The only catch is that they’re only
                available from July to September.</p>

            <p class="loose">So there you have it. The lowdown on cucumbers for
                pickling. Now get out there and start pickling!</p>

            <h2>That Brine Is Good Stuff</h2>

            <p class="loose">Don’t pour that pickle brine down the drain! You’d
                be wasting a precious resource. That brine is a goldmine of flavor
                that can give a boost to all kinds of dishes.</p>

            <p class="loose">Don’t believe me? Try <a
                    href="https://www.seriouseats.com/a-gazillion-ways-to-use-leftover-pickle-juice">adding
                    pickle brine to your salads, dressings, and marinades</a>. It adds a
                tangy, briny kick that’ll take your dishes to the next level. Or, if
                you’re feeling adventurous, you can even <a
                    href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pickle-juice-ice-pops">make
                    popsicles</a> out of it. Yeah, you heard me right. Pickle brine
                popsicles. Trust me, they’re better than they sound.</p>

            <p class="loose">And if you’re feeling thirsty, why not try using
                the brine in a <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/4-pickle-cocktails-in-nyc/">cocktail</a>
                or <a href="https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251">chaser</a>?
                It adds a unique flavor that’ll make your drinks stand out from
                the crowd. (Just please drink responsibly, folks.)</p>
