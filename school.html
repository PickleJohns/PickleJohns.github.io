            <h2>When I Say “New York Style”</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright listen up, folks. If you wanna talk about
                New York City’s good eats, you can’t leave out the kosher dill
                pickles. If you haven’t tasted one, then you’re missing out on a
                real treat. I mean, these crunchy babies are so iconic, you can find
                them at almost every deli and street cart in the city. They’re a
                real pick-me-up when you’re feeling down or need a quick snack.</p>

            <p class="loose">Let me paint you a picture: You’re walking down the
                streets of Manhattan, and you catch a whiff of that unmistakable
                smell of pickle brine. You know it’s coming from a nearby street
                cart, and you can’t resist the temptation to check it out. You order
                a hot dog, and the vendor asks if you want a pickle to go with it.
                Of course you do! And there it is, the perfect accompaniment to your
                hot dog – a big, juicy, kosher dill pickle, still cold from the
                refrigerated jar. You take a bite, and the satisfying crunch and
                tangy flavor make you remember why you love New York.</p>

            <p class="loose">But it’s not just food carts that serve up these
                delicious pickles. Head into any classic deli in the city, and
                you’re bound to see a big barrel of kosher dill pickles sitting in
                the corner. You order a classic pastrami sandwich or a towering
                corned beef on rye. You ask the guy behind the counter to throw in a
                few of his best kosher dill pickles, and he knows just what you
                mean. You take a bite of that big sandwich, and then follow it up
                with a bite of pickle. The combination of flavors and textures is
                out of this world.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now I’m getting a little <i>verklempt</i>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Oh, here’s something you might not know about the
                word “kosher” in the pickle world. It doesn’t necessarily mean
                following Jewish dietary laws. Nope, <b>“kosher” actually refers to
                    the use of garlic in the pickling brine</b>. And let me tell you,
                that garlic is what takes these pickles to the next level. It’s an
                old-school tradition that’s been around for ages, and it gives
                kosher dill pickles a flavor that’s truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

            <h2>My Pickles Are Fermented</h2>

            <p class="loose">When it comes to pickles, I don’t mess around. I
                want the best of the best – real, old-fashioned, kosher dill
                pickles, made the way they were meant to be.</p>

            <p class="loose"><b>So my pickles are made using a
                    lacto-fermentation process</b>
                (sv:
                <i>mjölksyrning</i>). What’s that, you say? It’s a technique
                that’s been around for centuries, and it involves letting the
                natural bacteria in the air and on the surface of the cucumbers
                work their magic to create a delicious brine. It’s a slower
                process, but it’s worth it – the result is a pickle that’s
                crisp, crunchy, and packed with flavor.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">But that’s not all. Fermented pickles are also full
                of probiotics, which are good bacteria that help support a healthy
                gut microbiome. It’s like a two-for-one deal – not only do these
                pickles taste great, but they’re good for you too.</p>

            <h2>Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright I’m about to drop some pickle knowledge on
                you. For pickling, you can use all kinds of cucumbers, but <b>it’s
                    really worth it to get your hands on the freshest ones
                    possible</b>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now, in Sweden, you’re likely to come across
                English cucumbers (sv: <i>slanggurkor</i>) in the supermarket. These
                long, thin-skinned cucumbers are available year-round and are
                wrapped in plastic to keep them fresh and reduce food waste. They
                have a mild flavor that works well for making pickle spears, so go
                ahead and slice them up.</p>

            <p class="loose">But if it’s the summer, you can look for Västerås
                cucumbers (sv: <i>västeråsgurkor</i>). These small, firm cucumbers
                are grown outdoors, and they’re perfect for pickling. The only catch
                is that they’re only available from July to September.</p>

            <h2>That Brine Is Good Stuff</h2>

            <p class="loose">Don’t pour that pickle brine down the drain! You’d
                be wasting a precious resource. That brine is a goldmine of flavor
                that can give a boost to all kinds of dishes.</p>

            <p class="loose">Don’t believe me? Try <a
                    href="https://www.seriouseats.com/a-gazillion-ways-to-use-leftover-pickle-juice">adding
                    pickle brine to your salads, dressings, and marinades</a>. It adds a
                tangy, briny kick that’ll take your dishes to the next level. Or, if
                you’re feeling adventurous, you can even <a
                    href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pickle-juice-ice-pops">make
                    popsicles</a> out of it. Yeah, you heard me right. Pickle brine
                popsicles. Trust me, they’re better than they sound.</p>

            <p class="loose">And if you’re feeling thirsty, why not try using
                the brine in a <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/4-pickle-cocktails-in-nyc/">cocktail</a>
                or <a href="https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251">chaser</a>?
                It adds a unique flavor that’ll make your drinks stand out from
                the crowd. (Just please drink responsibly, folks.)</p>
