            <h2>New York Style / Kosher Dill</h2>

            <p class="loose"><b>New York is well-known for its iconic foods,
                    including old-fashioned kosher dill pickles.</b> These kinds of
                pickles are a staple in delis and street carts all over the city and
                have been enjoyed for generations.</p>

            <p class="loose">In the pickle world, the word <b>“kosher” refers to
                    the use of garlic</b> in the pickling brine, not necessarily the
                adherence to Jewish dietary laws. The use of garlic in pickling is
                an age-old tradition, and it adds a dimension of flavor that sets
                kosher dill pickles apart from other pickles.</p>

            <h2>Fermentation</h2>

            <p class="loose">We take great pride in using traditional methods to
                create the perfect pickle. Unlike most supermarket pickles (which
                are boiled and preserved in a salt or vinegar solution), <b>our
                    kosher dill pickles are made using a natural lacto-fermentation
                    process</b> (sv: <i>mjölksyrning</i>). This results in a more crisp,
                crunchy texture and a complex tangy, briny flavor.</p>

            <p class="loose">What’s more, <b>fermented pickles are packed with
                    probiotics</b>, meaning that there’s plenty of good bacteria that
                contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.</p>

            <h2>Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">You can pickle all kinds of cucumbers.</p>

            <p class="loose">In Sweden, the most common type of cucumbers are
                <b>English cucumbers</b> (sv: <i>slanggurkor</i>). These are
                long, thin-skinned cucumbers with a mild flavor, commonly
                available in supermarkets year-round and sold in plastic wrap to
                maintain freshness and reduce food waste. You can slice these
                cucumbers in quarters for making pickle spears.
            </p>

            <p class="loose"><b>Västerås cucumbers</b> (sv:
                <i>västeråsgurkor</i>) are a type of small, firm cucumber that
                is typically grown outdoors during the summer months. Västerås
                cucumbers are great for pickling but are mostly only available
                from July to September.
