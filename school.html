            <h2>The Story of Pickle John</h2>

            <p class="loose">Once upon a time, in a land (Sweden) far from home
                (America), I found myself in a pickle (pun intended). I was craving
                New York-style kosher dill pickles. But all I could find were too
                salty (sv: <i>saltgurkor</i>) or too vinegary and sweet (sv:
                <i>ättiksgurkor</i>). Ugh! So I decided to make <b>real kosher
                    dill pickles</b>, the kind I used to snack on when I was a kid.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">I worked on the recipe for a long time, until <b>I
                    finally hit that perfect crunch, tangy flavor, and the right balance
                    of dill, garlic, salt, and spices</b>. I made a pickle that was
                worthy of the “New York” name!</p>

            <p class="loose">I was so proud of my creation that I knew I had to
                share it with the world (at least Stockholm). And that’s how Pickle
                John’s Old-Fashioned New York Style Kosher Dill Pickles was
                born.</p>

            <quote><i>“I didn’t choose the pickle life, the pickle life chose
                    me.” — P.J.</i></quote>

            <h2>When I Say New York Style</h2>

            <p class="loose">Folks, if you wanna talk about the good eats of New
                York City, you can’t leave out kosher dill pickles. <b>These crunchy
                    babies are so iconic, you can find them at almost every deli and
                    street cart in the city</b>. If you haven’t tasted one, then you’re
                missing out on a real treat.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">Lemme paint you a picture: Walking in Manhattan,
                you smell something irresistible from a nearby street cart. You
                order a steaming warm hot dog and get a juicy, cool kosher dill
                pickle for the perfect pairing. You take a bite, and the satisfying
                crunch and tangy flavor make you remember why you love New York.</p>

            <p class="loose">It’s not just food carts. Head into any authentic
                deli in the city, and you’re bound to see a big barrel of kosher
                dill pickles over there in the corner. You order a classic pastrami
                sandwich or a towering corned beef on rye. You bite into that big
                sandwich, and then follow it up with a bite of pickle. The
                combination of flavors and textures is outta this world.</p>

            <p class="loose">Oh, here’s something you might not know. It’s that
                the word “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber#Kosher_dill">kosher</a>”
                in the pickle world doesn’t necessarily mean following Jewish
                dietary laws. Nope, here <b>kosher refers to the traditional use of
                    garlic and dill in a salt brine</b>. And let me tell you, that’s
                what takes these pickles to the next level.</p>

            <h2>My Pickles Are Fermented and Then Chilled</h2>

            <p class="loose">When it comes to pickles, I don’t mess around. Like
                any New Yorker, I want the best of the best — real, old-fashioned,
                kosher dill pickles, made the way they were meant to be.</p>

            <p class="loose">Let me tell ya. Those supermarket pickles are all
                boiled and processed, which means they’re soggy and drowning in some
                eye-watering salt or vinegar solution. No, no, <b>if you want a real
                    pickle, you gotta go for a pickle that’s been fermented.</b> None of
                that boiling nonsense.</p>

            <p class="loose">Me, I make my pickles kosher-style, with a brine of
                water, salt, garlic, and dill — and then leave it alone at room
                temperature. That’s what we in the pickle business call
                “lacto-fermentation” (sv: <i>mjölksyrning</i>), an age-old technique
                that involves letting the natural bacteria in the air and on the
                surface of the cucumbers work their magic and break down the natural
                sugars in the cucumber, converting them into acid, which gives us a
                natural tanginess. After that, I stick them in the fridge, which
                locks in the flavor and texture.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">When you eat a proper kosher dill pickle, you can
                taste the complexity and depth of flavors — the garlic, the dill,
                the tangy brine — that come together with time and patience. It’s a
                whole different ballgame than those pickles you find sitting for
                who-knows-how-long on supermarket shelves.</p>

            <p class="loose">But that’s not all. <b>Fermented pickles are also
                    full of probiotics. I mean good bacteria that help support a healthy
                    gut microbiome</b>. It’s like a two-for-one deal — not only do these
                pickles taste great, but they’re good for you too.</p>

            <h2>That Brine Is Good Stuff</h2>

            <p class="loose">Hold up before you toss out that pickle juice. That
                stuff is like liquid gold, full of flavor and potential. It’s not
                something you wanna waste.</p>

            <p class="loose">Don’t believe me? Try <a
                    href="https://www.seriouseats.com/a-gazillion-ways-to-use-leftover-pickle-juice">adding
                    pickle brine to your salads, dressings, and marinades</a>. It adds a
                tangy kick that’ll take your cooking to the next level. Or, if
                you’re feeling adventurous, you can even <a
                    href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pickle-juice-ice-pops">make
                    popsicles</a> out of it. Yeah, you heard me right. Pickle juice
                popsicles. Trust me, they’re better than they sound.</p>

            <p class="loose">And if you’re feeling thirsty, why not try using
                pickle brine in a <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/4-pickle-cocktails-in-nyc/">cocktail</a>
                or <a href="https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251">chaser</a>?
                It adds a unique flavor that’ll make your drinks stand out from
                the crowd. (Just please drink responsibly, folks.)</p>
