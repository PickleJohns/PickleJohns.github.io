            <h2>When I Say “New York Style”</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright listen up, folks. If you wanna talk about
                New York’s good eats, you can’t leave out the kosher dill pickles.
                These crunchy babies are a deli and street cart staple, and have
                been satisfying hungry New Yorkers for generations.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now, let me tell you something about the word
                “kosher” in my world. It doesn’t necessarily mean that these pickles
                follow Jewish dietary laws. Nope, <b>“kosher” actually refers to the
                    use of garlic in the pickling brine</b>. And let me tell you, that
                garlic is what takes these pickles to the next level. It’s an
                old-school tradition that’s been around for ages, and it gives my
                pickles a flavor that’s truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

            <h2>My Pickles Are Fermented</h2>

            <p class="loose">Let me tell you something. I take my pickles
                seriously around here. Unlike those bland, supermarket pickles that
                are boiled and preserved with salt or vinegar, <b>my kosher dill
                    pickles are made the old-fashioned way, using a natural
                    lacto-fermentation process</b> (sv: <i>mjölksyrning</i>).</p>

            <p class="loose">What’s lacto-fermentation, you ask? It’s a
                technique that’s been used for centuries, where the natural bacteria
                in the air and on the surface of the cucumbers are allowed to do
                their thing and create a delicious brine that results in a crisp,
                crunchy texture and a tangy, briny flavor that’ll knock your socks
                off.</p>

            <p class="loose">And that’s not all. <b>These pickles are packed
                    with probiotics, meaning that they’re full of good bacteria</b>.
                That’s real important for a healthy gut microbiome. So not only are
                these pickles delicious, but they’re good for you too.</p>

            <h2>Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Have a seat, because I’m about to drop some pickle
                knowledge on you. When it comes to pickling, you can use all kinds
                of cucumbers, but let me tell you, <b>it’s worth it to get your
                    hands on the freshest ones possible</b>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Now, in Sweden, you’re likely to come across
                English cucumbers in the supermarket. These long, thin-skinned
                cucumbers are available year-round and are wrapped in plastic to
                keep them fresh and reduce food waste. They have a mild flavor that
                works well for making pickle spears, so go ahead and slice them
                up.</p>

            <p class="loose">But if it’s the summer, you can look for Västerås
                cucumbers. These small, firm cucumbers are grown outdoors, and
                they’re perfect for pickling. The only catch is that they’re only
                available from July to September.</p>

            <p class="loose">So there you have it. The lowdown on cucumbers for
                pickling. Now get out there and start pickling!</p>

            <h2>That Brine Is Good Stuff</h2>

            <p class="loose">Don’t pour that pickle brine down the drain! You’d
                be wasting a precious resource. That brine is a goldmine of flavor
                that can give a boost to all kinds of dishes.</p>

            <p class="loose">Don’t believe me? Try <a
                    href="https://www.seriouseats.com/a-gazillion-ways-to-use-leftover-pickle-juice">adding
                    pickle brine to your salads, dressings, and marinades</a>. It adds a
                tangy, briny kick that’ll take your dishes to the next level. Or, if
                you’re feeling adventurous, you can even <a
                    href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pickle-juice-ice-pops">make
                    popsicles</a> out of it. Yeah, you heard me right. Pickle brine
                popsicles. Trust me, they’re better than they sound.</p>

                the brine in a <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/4-pickle-cocktails-in-nyc/">cocktail</a>
                or <a href="https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251">chaser</a>?
