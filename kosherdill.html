            <p class="loose">Pickle John’s Old-Fashioned New York Style Kosher
                Dill Pickles are a true taste of the Big Apple. <b>New York is
                    well-known for its iconic foods, including classic kosher dill
                    pickles.</b> These pickles are a staple in delis and street carts
                all over the city and have been enjoyed for generations.</p>

            <p class="loose">At Pickle John’s, we take great pride in using
                traditional methods to create the perfect pickle. Unlike most
                supermarket pickles, <b>our kosher dill pickles are made using an
                    all-natural lacto-fermentation process</b> (sv:
                <i>mjölksyrning</i>), which results in a crisp, crunchy texture
                and a complex tangy, briny flavor. What’s more, fermented
                pickles are packed with probiotics, which are good bacteria that
                contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">Here in the pickle world, the word <b>“kosher”
                    refers to the use of garlic</b> in the pickling brine, not
                necessarily the adherence to Jewish dietary laws. The use of garlic
                in pickling is an age-old tradition, and it adds a dimension of
                flavor that sets kosher dill pickles apart from other pickles.</p>

            <p class="loose">All of that is why Pickle John’s Old-Fashioned New
                York Style Kosher Dill Pickles really are, well, authentic
                Old-Fashioned New York Style Kosher Dill Pickles!
