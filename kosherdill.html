            <p class="loose">When it comes to food, New York is famous for
                pizza, bagels, deli sandwiches — and <b>kosher dill pickles</b>.
                These pickles are a staple in delis and street carts all over the
                city</b>, and they are an iconic part of New York's food culture.
                They are <b>tangy, salty, and crunchy</b>, with just the right
                amounts of garlic, dill and spices.</p>

            <p class="loose">Here, in the pickle world, the word <b>"kosher"
                    refers to the presence of garlic</b> in the pickling brine, and not
                necessarily to compliance with Jewish dietary laws — although kosher
                dill pickles are typically also made according to Kosher
                requirements.</p>

            <p class="loose">That’s another reason why Pickle John’s
                Old-Fashioned New York Style Kosher Dill Pickles really are, well,
                authentic <b>old-fashioned New York-style kosher dill pickles</b>!
