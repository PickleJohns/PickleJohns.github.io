            <p class="loose">So, once upon a time, in a land (Sweden) far from
                home (America), I found myself in a real pickle (pun intended). I
                was craving the taste of old-fashioned New York-style kosher dill
                pickles, but all the pickles I could find were too salty (sv:
                <i>saltgurkor</i>) or too sweet and vinegary (sv:
                <i>ättiksgurkor</i>). I mean, you cannot just eat those things!
                So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make
                <b>proper kosher dill pickles, the kind I used to snack on when
                    I was a kid</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">For a long time, I worked on perfecting the recipe,
                trying to get that just-right crunch and the perfect balance of
                ingredients that make kosher dill pickles so delicious
                (dill-icious?). And after a ton of trial and error, I finally did
                it! I made a pickle that was worthy of the “New York” name. <b>It
                    had the perfect crunch, tangy flavor, and the right balance of dill,
                    garlic, salt, and spices</b>.</p>

            <p class="loose">I was so proud of my creation that I knew I had to
                share it with the world (at least Stockholm). And that’s how Pickle
                John’s Old-Fashioned New York Style Kosher Dill Pickles was
                born.</p>
