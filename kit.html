            <h2>Anyone Can Pickle!</h2>

            <p class="loose">It’s me, Pickle John. If you’re like me and you
                love a good pickle, then you gotta <b>try my Pickle John’s Kosher
                    Dill D.I.Y. Pickling Kit</b>.</p>

            <p class="loose">Making pickles might sound fancy and hard, but my
                kit makes it easy. <b>All you gotta do is add fresh cucumbers and
                    water,</b> and in just a few days, you’ll have authentic New
                York-style kosher dill pickles. (If you want, you can customize the
                flavor by adding things like fresh garlic, dill, chili, sugar.)
            </p>

            <p class="loose">And folks, <b>there’s nothing like the feeling of
                    making your own pickles</b>. It’s a fun and rewarding experience,
                something you can share with family and friends. Even kids can be
                pickle magicians, turning boring cucumbers into something
                magical.</p>

            <p class="loose">So <a href="/store">order a kit</a> today, and
                bring the taste of New York to your kitchen. Trust me, you won’t go
                back to supermarket pickles once you try it!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>1.4 kg cucumbers</b> (about 5 <i>slanggurkor</i>)<br>
                    <p>Any type of cucumber can be pickled. Look for fresh, firm
                        ones. [More about <a href="#cucumbers">cucumbers</a>

                    <p>You can use a small plate or cut-up plastic lid + jar.

            <h2 id="cucumbers">Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright I’m about to drop some cucumber knowledge
                on you. For pickling, <b>you can really use any type of
                    cucumber</b>, but you want to get your hands on the freshest ones
                possible.
            </p>

            <li class="loose">In Sweden, <b>you’re most likely to come across
                    English cucumbers</b> (sv: <i>slanggurkor</i>). These long,
                thin-skinned cucumbers are available year-round in the supermarket
                and come wrapped in plastic to keep them fresh longer. They work
                well for making pickle halves or spears (i.e. long wedges). Just
                slice ‘em up.</li>

            <li class="loose">That said, <b>you’ll want to keep an eye out for
                    mini cucumbers</b> (sv: <i>snackgurkor</i>). They’re more expensive
                but worth the extra. They’re firm and thin-skinned and perfectly
                pickle-sized. In other words, they’re ideal for pickling!</li>

            <li class="loose">If it’s the summer, <b>you can try to get a hold of
                    Västerås cucumbers</b> (sv: <i>västeråsgurkor</i>). These small-ish
                cucumbers are grown outdoors, so they have good flavor. The only
                catch is that they’re only available from July to September.</li>

            <h2 id="container">You Don’t Need a Fancy Container</h2>

            <p class="loose">Now, you might be picturing a traditional glass
                mason jar, but let me tell ya, you can pickle cucumbers in just
                about anything, from last week’s ice cream container to an old
                bathtub.</p>

            <p class="loose" id="inner-cover"><b>The key to pickling success is
                    to keep your cucumbers submerged in the brine</b> by using some sort
                of weighted inner cover. Put a small plate or saucer on top of your
                cucumbers. Or cut up an old plastic lid, then add a small jar or
                something else on top. It doesn’t have to be fancy, as long as it
                prevents cucumbers from floating to the surface.
            </p>

            <h2>The Deal About Salt</h2>

            <p class="loose">If you’re checking the ingredients of my D.I.Y.
                kit, you might be curious about that calcium chloride (sv:
                <i>kalciumklorid</i>). Well, it’s simple: <b>Calcium chloride is
                    a specialty salt, used in making many common food products —
                    like in cheese, beer, and tofu.</b> It can be naturally found in
                seawater, and it’s considered safe by food safety regulatory
                agencies.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">We also use sea salt, a.k.a. sodium chloride (sv:
                <i>natriumklorid</i>), of course, to enhance flavor and draw out
                excess water. That’s important for achieving that signature pickle
                crunch. <b>But we don’t want to use too much regular salt. It’s not
                    healthy to consume a ton of sodium, you know.</b>
            </p>

            <p class="loose">That’s where the calcium chloride comes in. It
                helps to maintain the texture of the cucumbers and prevent them from
                becoming mushy. <b>The result: crispy pickles that stay crispy — all
                    while using less regular salt.</b>
            </p>
