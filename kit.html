            <h2 id="cucumbers">Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright I’m about to drop some cucumber knowledge
                on you. For pickling, you can use all types of cucumbers, but
                <b>it’s sure worth it to get your hands on the freshest ones
                    possible</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">In Sweden, <b>you’re most likely to come across
                    English cucumbers (sv: <i>slanggurkor</i>)</b>. These long,
                thin-skinned cucumbers are available year-round in the supermarket
                and are wrapped in plastic to keep them fresh and reduce waste. They
                work really well for making pickle halves or spears (i.e. long
                wedges). Just slice them up.</p>

            <p class="loose">That said, <b>you’ll want to keep an eye out for
                    mini cucumbers (sv: <i>snackgurkor</i>)</b>. They’re more expensive
                but worth the extra. They’re firm and thin-skinned and perfectly
                pickle-sized. In other words, they’re ideal for pickling!</p>

            <p class="loose">If it’s the summer, <b>you can try to get a hold of
                    Västerås cucumbers (sv: <i>västeråsgurkor</i>)</b>. These small-ish
                cucumbers are grown outdoors, so they have good flavor. The only
                catch is that they’re only available from July to September.</p>

            <h2 id="container">You Don’t Need a Fancy Container</h2>

            <p class="loose">Now, I know you’re probably picturing that pretty
                traditional glass mason jar, but let me tell ya, there are more
                things to pickle in than you can shake a stick at.</p>

            <p class="loose">First off, <b>let’s talk about upcycling</b>. You
                know, when you take something old and turn it into something new.
                You can pickle cucumbers in just about anything, from last week’s ice
                cream container to an old bathtub.</p>

            <p class="loose" id="inner-cover">The key to pickling success is making sure your
                cucumbers stay submerged in the brine. That’s why <b>it’s important
                    to use a container in which you can easily weigh down your
                    pickles</b>. It doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive, just
                something that’ll get the job done.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">A simple trick is to place a small plate or saucer
                on top of your pickles to keep them submerged. If you want to get
                really crafty, you can even up a flexible plastic lid or container.
                Then, <b>on top of that plate or lid, use a small jar or can as a
                    weight to keep it all in place</b>
                and prevent your pickles from floating to the surface.</p>

            <pre>
                |   ###   | <- weight (e.g. a jar or can)
                | ======= | <- inner cover (e.g. a saucer or cut-up plastic lid)
                |CUCUMBERS|
                |CUCUMBERS|
                ‘---------’               
            </pre>

            <p class="loose">So, there you have it, folks. From an old-school
                wooden barrel to a shiny <a
                    href="https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/ikea-365-matlada-rektangulaer-plast-60393066/">IKEA
                    365+ plastic food container</a>, there’s a whole world of options
                out there. Just remember, if you’re gonna do it yourself, feel free
                to do it your own way.</p>

            <h2>The Deal About Salt</h2>

            <p class="loose">If you’re checking out the ingredients of Pickle
                John’s Kosher Dill D.I.Y. Pickling Kit, you might be curious about
                that calcium chloride (sv: <i>kalciumklorid</i>). Well, there’s not
                need to worry. <b>Calcium chloride is a specialty salt, used in
                    making many common food products — like in cheese, beer, and
                    tofu.</b> It can be naturally found in seawater, and it’s considered
                safe by food safety regulatory agencies.</p>

            <p class="loose">Of course, <b>we also use sea salt, a.k.a. sodium
                    chloride (sv: <i>natriumklorid</i>), to enhance flavor and draw out
                    excess water</b>. That’s important for achieving that signature
                pickle crunch. But we don’t want to use too much regular salt. It’s
                not healthy to consume a ton of sodium, folks!</p>

            <p class="loose">That’s where the calcium chloride comes in. It
                strengthens the natural pectin in veggies, helping to maintain the
                texture of the cucumbers and prevent them from becoming mushy.
                <b>The result: crispy pickles that stay crispy — all while using
                    less regular salt.</b>
