            <p class="loose">Now, I’m not gonna lie, making pickles can sound
                fancy and hard. But with my Pickle John’s D.I.Y. Kosher Dill
                Pickling Kit, I think anyone can do it. This kit is a game-changer.

                time, and they’ll last for weeks in the fridge. Give them as a gift

                something magical.</p>

                D.I.Y. Kosher Dill Pickling Kit today, and bring the taste of New
                York to your kitchen. Trust me, once you try it, you’ll never go
                back to supermarket pickles again.</p>

            <h2>Let Me Tell You About Cucumbers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Alright I’m about to drop some cucumber knowledge
                on you. For pickling, you can use all types of cucumbers, but
                <b>it’s sure worth it to get your hands on the freshest ones
                    possible</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">In Sweden, <b>you’re most likely to come across
                    English cucumbers (sv: <i>slanggurkor</i>)</b>. These long,
                thin-skinned cucumbers are available year-round in the supermarket
                and are wrapped in plastic to keep them fresh and reduce waste. They
                work really well for making pickle halves or spears (i.e. long
                wedges), so go ahead and slice them up.</p>

            <p class="loose">Next time you’re in the supermarket, <b>keep an eye
                    out for mini cucumbers (sv: <i>snackgurkor</i>)</b>. They’re more
                expensive but they’re small and have thin skin, so they’re good for
                pickling.</p>

            <p class="loose">If it’s the summer, <b>you can try to get a hold of
                    Västerås cucumbers (sv: <i>västeråsgurkor</i>)</b>. These small
                cucumbers are grown outdoors, so they have good flavor. The only
                catch is that they’re only available from July to September.</p>

            <h2>Here’s The Deal About Containers</h2>

            <p class="loose">Now, I know you’re probably picturing the
                traditional glass mason jar, but let me tell ya, there are more
                things to pickle in than you can shake a stick at.</p>

            <p class="loose">First off, <b>let’s talk about upcycling</b>. You
                know, when you take something old and turn it into something new.
                You can pickle cucumbers in just about anything, from a plastic
                lunchbox container to an old bathtub.</p>

            <p class="loose">The key to pickling success is making sure your
                cucumbers stay submerged in the brine. That’s why <b>it’s important
                    to use a container in which you can easily weigh down your
                    pickles</b>. It doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive, just
                something that’ll get the job done.
            </p>

            <p class="loose">A simple trick is to place a small plate or saucer
                on top of your pickles to keep them submerged. If you want to get
                really crafty, you can even cut up a flexible plastic lid or
                container. Then, <b>on top of your plate or lid, use a small jar or
                    can as a weight to keep it all in place</b> to prevent your pickles
                from reaching the surface.</p>

            <pre>
                |  [###]  | <- weight (small jar, etc.)
                | ======= | <- inner cover (saucer, cut-up lid, etc.)
                |CUCUMBERS| <- fully submerged in brine
                |CUCUMBERS|
                ‘---------’               
            </pre>

            <p class="loose">So, there you have it, folks. From last week’s ice
                cream container to wooden barrels, there’s a whole world of options
                out there. Just remember, if you’re gonna do it yourself, do it your
                own way.</p>
